review,rating
"garbage, full of magic  , not inspiration at all, this is story of a prodigy guy who just tried a little and got everythingthis is not story of a hardworking person who got successjust magic helped and he had luck and he became richi don't understand why everybody loved this book as this book does not even relate remotely to realityworthless book.",1
i've read this book and it is one that people either love or really feel let down after they read it. this book has reached incredible and immense heights of fame and so each new reader has a high level of expectation and because of this when you finally read it there is a huge sense of feeling let down.this book is a lot better than most books but it isn't one of the best ones there are.you will be one of two people after you read it. you'll either love it or you'll feel it really could .,1
i got the book in time but some pages of book are not printed well. at least give us quality product as we are consumer who is paying for your service.,1
"this copy is a pirated one.even a child can recognize it .poor finishing , text printing is not in same lines in many pages. ink marks in many pages.",1
page quality worst.,1
this book is so overrated it is looking overrated in the rearview mirror.complete philosophical nonsense.feels like every other self help book crap.please dont waste your money and time buying this.would have given this zero rating if there was an option for that.,1
the reason i gave five stars is the quality of pages is very poor.,1
pages are missing. do check the page number .,1
this book is hugely overrated. don't expect a life changing contents in this book.  though if you are a book lover may read  this book and forget it. nothing special. that's all.,1
the quality of the book i recived is very bad it look torned from the front and had marks all over books .very disappointed with this order definitely was not expecting this from a big brand like flipkart. doesn't even deserve a  one star .a total disappointment i hope other think before purchasing this.,1
"never read a book more shit than this.even amish's ""oath of the vayuputras"" was better.i gave the one star only because i came to know from where the ""om shanti om"" dialogue was copied.",1
"after hearing so much about this book from friends,reading the reviews, after seeing this book sweep the ""favorite book"" of amateur readers i gave it a try. to my horror it is one of the most disappointing book i've ever read. the story reminds me of my 6th class pointless moral science lesson. spend ypur hard earned money on something else.",1

clothe is bad quality.,1

the book is waste of money and time and  the pages are not so clear as it looks like xerox pieceplease dont but it guys.but the story of the book is awesummmmm.,1
i found the book very disappointing and had to give it away to one of my cousins to save myself the embarrassment of finding myself with the book in possession!!.,1
"an amalgam of inconclusive aesop fables and whimsical plots.i dont get the hype around the author whose books are merely old wine in a new bottle.screw the chronology,introduce a third world set-up, conjure a mental instagram of supposed fairy kingdoms and bam! you got yourself a glossy 200 paged paulo coulho novel.the whole journey was obvious and rugged like the paper quality.",1
the ending is greatly disappointing and hilarious. why would any one purchase such a book? better keep off this crap.,1
"either i am not able to understand this novel or this is just another boring book. i really don‚Äôt understand how so many copies of this novel have been sold!!!!! i request all the readers of this novel please share your true comments about it and let me know if i am a mentally challenged person, who is unable to understand the intensity of the story and its characters!!!.",1
get duplicate boom.,1
low quality paper and smudged print.!!.,1
duplicate (pirated).,1
it is not worth a single penny.,1
"the book was delivered me in just a plastic bag, there was not even a air bubble wrapping plastic on the book and the book's cover/pages were folded from all the sides. at least you can deliver it in a cardboard box with a bookmark in it.",1
"alchemist was supposed to be this life changing book, but i failed to find any meaning or sense in it. the story does not make a strong impact on you. i could not relate to any of the characters. the book is a breeze to read, but that does not make it a great book as it us put out to be.",2
its a good book.no doubt in that. some good advices.but not weaved in a proper story line.its just like some one is advising you.may be its just me.but seeing the number of copies sold.i thot it must be some great book.but i got bored while reading it.not to mention disappointed when the title-the alchemist- is not that important character in the story.,2
"book no doubt is one of the best book but the print was horrible ,i mean it was not aligned properly some of the word was so difficult to read.",2
"sorry but i didn't like this book , after reading more than 100 pages i didn't get what author wanted to say. i bought it after reading it's reviews but it didn't stand up to my expectations.",2
"its a fine read. the story is nothing exceptional. we find the rags-to-riches story almost everywhere and in tons of other books.was not very convinced after reading it but since i have heard so many reviews of this book i had to go for it.in short, doesn't deserve the hype it has generated.",2
book is kind of old-ish and pages doesn't feel good quality .,2
"fiction readers who want to start reading philosophical books .the alchemist could be a good choice but for those only into philosophy /slight spirituality , might not be an extremly good book . however you can give it a try .you might like it  :) :).",2
"total waste of money and time:(it is vague, sometimes appears too spiritual. difficult to comprehend. may be a great literary work but not for me!.",2
delivered on time but its boring for me üòÖ.,2
"6 pages of the book weren't printed at all, they were empty pages, it disrupts the flow of reading which is very irritating.",2

"paper quality was worst i have ordered this book around 5,6 times but never got a book of such worst paper quality.",2
poor quality.,2
2 pages were torn.,2
2 stars are for not giving a bookmark which doesn't hold more value than 2 rupees.,2
"from page 64 to 103, the page are not serially wise.it is difficult to read like this.",2
just okay.,2
over rated.yet convincing book.,2

"only books can change the whole world , our way of thinking,  also the the readers.  so read books maximum  how much you can . there are lots of good  books on flpkart . this book is one of them.",2
no full sealed.no book mark.disrupt few page .disappointed .,2

the book is not so good packing is bad but the novel and the story is good.packing is very bad.,2
gd product.,2
nice one.,2
book awesome but which seller delivered this book.book page print quality is not good.,2
"i don't need to say how good this book. i've read this many times. i had bought this to gift to someone, but book quality is not good. it feels like it is pirated or something.",2
the paper quality is bad . i have a suspicion . it might be a counterfeit copy.,2
the book i received is damaged one. but i can read though .,2
"lot of guys have  me that you should read it ,waste of my money and time.",2
gud book.,2
i am continuous reader of mr.jeyamohan's writings.that's why i felt like it is not what i expected.but in the end i made a decision that i will follow my dreams.thanks to author for that.!.,2
its not much interesting. throughout the book it only revolves around d idea that if u want to achieve something then mysterious invisible forces will help you achieve it. instead of this read chetan bhagat or jk rowling.,2
"alchemist is actually not a great story with twist or turns but just a simple account of struggle you face in your  daily life.it deals with the fear the people  have in realising their dreams.it's very spiritual talking about things like 'soul of the world' ,'omens' ,'language of the world' etc.so , if u are looking for getting transported to the another world then this is not your pick.",2
"i purchased the alchemist with certainly no prejudices in mind, other than the fact that it is targeted at readers constantly interested in ‚Äúself-improvement‚Äù.when i was going through the alchemist at one of the book stores it said that the alchemist opened the eyes of the editors and that reading the alchemist was like waking up to a  morning lit by the sun. crass-i tell you. it is no such thing.but certainly the alchemist is a book written many years back in the 1988 in a foreign language.",3
"this book was okay. i think the message of this book is follow your dreams. i liked it; but i am not sure that i would recommend it. i enjoyed the imagery of the alchemist. the story moved a bit slowly. it wasn't a page turner, but it wasn't a tough read either. the alchemist is a nice fable;but, that's it.",3
"the product was delivered quickly and the delivery guy was also very nice though he wasn't carrying any change. the book is interesting however its quality is not up to mark, a few pages from the author's note are missing, sellers fault. apart from the missing pages i'm satisfied :).",3
"the alchemist"" - a well written very easy language book which contains some good instances to show no matter what happens one should follow his/her dreams .literally.i think the book is a bit over rated as there are many other books which shows  the same concept in a more beautiful and illustrative way.",3
"the book is definitely overrated! it is not an exciting read! don't let the reviews delude you into thinking that it is a must read book!! not at all! if you happen to be a voracious reader and love the novels of some of the best authors,this book may not be for you! it is simply not a page turner as the reviews deem it to be!! the story proceeds at a slow pace! and the climax let me down!! a book with just 150 pages that could have been read in a day or two ,took me more than a week.and .",3
"the story of alchemist is somehow inspiring for those pursuing their dreams and passion. the plot of the story has been laid perfectly by the author though some events may bore you while reading. the manner in which a shepherd boy, santiago (the name appears only once in the whole novel!!!) takes a journey away home to the pyramids of egypt in search of his dream treasure is mesmerizing. the story has a beautiful message for every reader and the whole story revolves around that message.nic.",3
"the alchemist is a good book, but not that great as people says. paper quality was good. super service from flipkart.",3
lightening fast delivery from flipkart. a good book where the author tries to describe human nature and its assimilation with the surroundings. not as good as hyped but simply enjoyable.,3
"plot: a boy (main protagonist) has a recurring dream,and comes to learn from a woman about some treasure in egypt which is linked to his dream.he goes in pursuit of the treasure and gets a life time of experience while doing so.comment:the book sometimes look like self-help books rather than literature.for eg:something used in om shanti om -""if you want something,all the universe conspires to help you achieve it"".recommendation:a nice read.",3
the written material is great and marvelous but the physical condition of book is not good. next time i don't expect to buy anything from flipkart. please try to give quality products.,3
"for dis much price, the quality of d book is not worth it. little bit of disappointment.though it was readable.",3
overall the story was ok.but lastly talking with the sun & the wind was extremely dramatic. could have been made more realistic.,3
simple language easy to read.,3
